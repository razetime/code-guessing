1. two space indentation, short var names, python.
   Short enough to be written in a few hours.
   `t,r,a,n,s` seen in code.
   Guess is soup girl.
   **Actual**: Anima Libera.
2. Comments suggest Lyricly arguing with self like previous rounds.
   Code requires a nintendo switch. comes with a streamable link i can't open.
   Guess is Lyricly. Correct.
3. Rust, has license, which is not very logos-like,
   added new operations, a little creative.
   olus also "anonymously" outed more details about the VM in chat.
   Guess is olus. **Actual:** kimapr.
4. uses tab zones, and written in haskell. Somewhat golfed.
   Soup Girl has done this, GNU has done this, logos has done this.
   Guess is luatic. few other places to put them.
   **Actual:** GNU. I should just guess the most obvious person.
5. Js, long variable names. Tab user.
   Some knowledge of APL. Purposefully awkward logos impersonation.
   Silly float usage. file is lightly misspelled. funny variable names.
   Guess is ultlang. 
6. bzip archive of a Factor source file.
   uses `<< ALIAS: CHAR: ' >>` which is used in taswell's boil repository.
   Guess is taswell.
   **Actual:** olus. People did not try to mask their identity this round.
7. my solution, which is very similar to the ruby impl.
   If anyone notices this they are pretty good.
   Or maybe the plainness of the program gives it away.
   Unguessed. Mistaken for olus a lot.
8. Code guessing ascii art, also haskell. lots of dependencies.
   Uses megaparsec, only lyricly or olivia talk about that.
   Guess is Anima Libera.
   **Actual:** Olivia. I should've just followed my own observations.
9. Chicken Scheme, provides usage instructions. Two space indent.
   **I changed my guess on account of olus's tomfoolery.** Very clean and concise impl.
   Logos has used lisp long ago, so this may not be far off.
   Guess is Logos. Maybe olus got me.
   **Actual:** luatic. Apparently they talk a lot about scheme.
10. a cute approach in lua named as a python file.
    Guessing kimapr because i have no other idea.
    **Actual:** Soup girl. I would not have guessed this.
11. Nix, using nix-parsec. seems only GNU would write this.
    Logos does not like nix, so this might be a misdirection.
    Guess is GNU.
    **Actual:** taswell. I would not have guessed this either.
12. ELF executable with usage instructions.
    apparently uses some jank and needs a wrapper.
    Guess is (reluctantly) Olivia.
    **Actual:** Logos. Might be the worst bungle of this round.
